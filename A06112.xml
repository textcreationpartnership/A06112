            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Wherein lyke foule Hypocrites they do bely them ſelues ſhamful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly:
<pb facs="tcp:1773:10"/>they do ſclaunder the trueth, and the holy worde of God: they hurt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences of many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, whiche beleuynge theyr wordes: vnder a zeale &amp; holines ſpoken, do fall ignorauntly from the trueth.

But here we may ſe the prouerbe true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Honores mutant mores. There was a ryghte godly man, whiche on a tyme dyd ſaye to a biſhoppe: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sathan had deceyued, being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the ryghte waye: I am glad that I am no biſhop: or if I were once a biſhop, I am glad y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I dyd forſake it, or elles I feare me er thys tyme I ſhoulde haue bene caryed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth, as well as you.

<pb facs="tcp:1773:11"/>of God: and finally, hym ſelfe not to be a whitte the worſe thereby: Yea or nay. This queſtion being ſoluted, that nothyng ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſaied to the contrary: as the Pſalme doth miniſter occaſion, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie many, whiche do affirme that in no caſe a man oughte to ſwere or to make an othe whether it be commaunded hym of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate or voluntarily, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tending that it is ſynne to vſe any othe: for aſmuche as Chriſte did forbid vs to ſwere at all: but that oure communication ſhoulde be ended wyth yea and naye. Beinge alſo many of a contrary ſorte, whiche thynkyng it no ſynne at al (ſwere they neuer ſo muche) but rather ſuppoſinge them ſelues beſt men: whiche ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuent and deuiſe moſt diueliſhe othes paſſynge all other (As by familiar exemple) There
<pb facs="tcp:1773:12"/>were two tranſgreſſors caſte in priſon, in one of the counters in London for a certeyne robberie committed: whiche, as they were merily diſpoſed (theyr harlottes beinge wyth them to confort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) the one of the theues ſayd to the other. Let vs ſit doune at this ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble one agaynſte the other, and he that can outſwere the other ſhal paye nothynge for his breakfaſt, he that is ouercome ſhall paye for all. Such was theyr ſwering and ſtarynge, ſuche was the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge and rentinge of the Lorde, ſuche was the rehearſall of all the partes of the Lorde his body pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy and aperte, that no godly crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture can abide to here it agayne. Whoſe ende wythin three dayes after was hangyng, a meete pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmente for theyr impietie and blaſphemy, if there had ben none
<pb facs="tcp:1773:12"/>other crime to be puniſhed. I woulde to Chriſt the magiſtrates woulde loke ſome thynge on thys matter. Concerning therfore the makyng of othes, by the waye of a queſtion oure writer diſcuſſeth whether it be lawful and ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding wyth the worde of God to ſwere, either voluntarily or elles by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the magiſtrates and ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers. Whether they be bounde to keepe &amp; perfourme the oth, which they hane ſworne: if it be to theyr hurte and preiudice, whiche do make the othe. Whether an othe made w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out addyng of the name of god in the makinge thereof do bynde the ſwerer to the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunce of the othe. Whether all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wythout exception are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to keepe their othes by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made. Whether any magiſtrate can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence wyth an othe lawefully
<pb facs="tcp:1773:13"/>made, yea or naye. In thys parte alſo he diſcuſſeth the queſtion of votaries: whether that a man maye make a vowe, and whether that vowes being made do binde the votaries, yea or naye. What vowes do binde and what do not what men are bounde, and what they be who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr vowes do not binde to the perfourming of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. All theſe demaundes beinge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, wherein is greate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and learnyng: more then in a.

In thys poynte he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an excellente piece of worke. He ſheweth what vſurie is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge to be vnpoſſible that vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers

O merciful Lorde what ſhal become of a greate nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of riche men: whiche knowynge no ende of theyr goodes: dyd neuer come by the hundreth parte of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they do poſſeſſe, by any other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt meane and lawfull crafte, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by thys meane whiche is ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and damnable: that it deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth at the laſt both body &amp; ſoule. If many which are worth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes, ſhoulde reſtore but halfe that, whiche they haue by thys vngodly meane obteined &amp; gotte: of their thouſandes howe fewe hundredes ſhould they haue left, nay how many thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des ſhould they be in dette? There are ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe &amp; many kyndes of vſuries, that almoſt a man can not reken
<pb facs="tcp:1773:14"/>them vp. Yea it is ſo craftie and ſubtil a kinde of occupiynge, that when a man ſhal thynke him ſelfe leſt burdeyned, then ſhal he finde hym ſelfe at the laſte mooſte ſore cutte. As by exemple, what man woulde not thynke hym ſelfe wel at eaſe, if he myght borowe an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drede pounde, to paye weekly for one yere ſpace, but one peny for euerie pounde, whiche amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting to an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drede pence for one weeke maketh by the yeres ende, fiftie &amp; two hundrede pence, whiche are poundes. xxi. and. xiii. ſhyllinges and four pence. Howe wel at eaſe is thys man nowe, when he ſhall perceiue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he leeſeth ſo muche by ſuche ſmall driblettes, as by one peny meele, thynkyng before that it was nothynge at all (to ſpeake of) to gyue one peny for the lone of a pounde weekly? Much more
<pb facs="tcp:1773:14"/>doth that man leeſe, whiche doth paye two pence in the pounde for euerie weekes lone. What great gaines therby co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the vſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rer, which of his hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drede pounde ſhoulde make by the yeres ende one. C. xl. &amp;. iii. li vi. s. viii. d. An other ſorte of vſurers there are: whiche do not lende their money weekly, but for the yere, by the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drede, takyng for euerie hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drede, ſome xv. li. ſome. xx li ſome. xxx. li The whiche is the moſte gentle ſort of vſurers, of thoſe which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to be rich by their craft and occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But there is an other ſort beinge no men, but diuils of hel, makinge them ſelues ſo holy, that to winne a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de pounde they woulde not ſeme to play the vſurers. At whoſe hande if an ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſt man beinge in neceſſitie, and hauynge neede, woulde borowe
<pb facs="tcp:1773:15"/>a litle peece of money to ſerue his purpoſe: promiſing to giue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome thynge for the lone thereof, they wyll deteſte and curſe that kynde of gayne, they wil ſpitte at it: and yet lyke foule hypocrites thei be ten times worſe and more abominable in the ſyghte of God and man, then that other before rehearſed. They wyl ſort &amp; point furth ſuch wares for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche are in neceſſitie for the tyme, that where as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nowe but in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, he ſhall be broughte to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme calamitie and miſerie, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng ſuche wares at theyr ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, as haukes cappes, taſſels for hau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes, haukes bels, poyntes, broune paper, wyth ſuche other peltrie ware, that the poore man ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer make the fourth peny of his ware agayue, that it had ben leſſe harme for hym to haue loſte. xx. or

And by thys meanes, by a colour of bying and ſellyng, thys foule vſurer woulde colour his vſurie wyth more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion &amp; vndoing of them which haue to do with him, then the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifeſt vſurers and open extorcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. There is an other company of them whiche wyll lende theyr money wyth a good wyl, takyng no maner of gayne and profit for the lone thereof: but yet they do meane no leſſe Diueliſhneſſe in
<pb facs="tcp:1773:16"/>theyr herte then the other. For if they do lende a man .xx. pounde &amp; take nothinge for the vſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet they wyll paye him home one waye or other that he ſhall wrynge for it. They wyl ſell hym ſome olde broken wynded horſe, ſome pretie rynge wyth a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited ſtone, ſome olde layed &amp; braithed piece of chamlet, or ſome ſuche lyke trifel that he ſhal leeſe in that whiche was bought, fyue or ſixe pounde for the pleaſure of the .xx. li. being lent to hym. And thus they do voyed pretelie by thys legerdemayne the name of an vſurer. They ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle their mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters ſo craftely that God (as they do perſuade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue theyr vſurie. What great landes haue theſe vſurers gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by forfetynge of bondes, the pore men being ſo bounde in our lady

There is amonge them no more redemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion then in hell, that the poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſinge w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſoule prieſtes
<q>Heu me, quia in inferno nulla eft redemptio.</q> They maye crie out to the Lorde w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ordes, plucke me (good Lorde) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iawes of hel.

            <p>Wherefore to conclude in fewe wordes: hangyng is to fayre &amp; to eaſie a death for them, whiche are ſo abominable traytours both to God and man, whiche do robbe &amp; kyll not one or twayne by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high waye ſyde for neede: but ſittynge at home in theyr cheares banket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
<pb facs="tcp:1773:23"/>and feaſtyng, they do robbe and vndoo al the world both high and lowe. All is fiſhe wyth them that cometh to the net.

For they wyll neuer repent and reſtore agayne their wronge gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ryches. They do perceyue: that if they ſhoulde ſo do (euerie byrde hauyng his fether home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne) that then they ſhoulde be lefte as naked as my nayle, they ſhoulde not haue a ſherte to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them wyth, I truſt the good and godly wyll be herewyth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng

            <p>After thys matter our Doctor demaundeth.

Deut. xvii. but to wey all cauſes by the ryghte lyne and balaunce of iuſtice. He declareth
<pb facs="tcp:1773:26"/>to them: that it is theft and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie for a Iudge to take gyftes of anie man which is a ſueter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hym, not onely bicauſe it is a ſellynge of iuſtice, an occaſion of wronge iudgement, and a depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng or robbyng of the innocent in his iuſt cauſe, but alſo though he be neuer ſo muche indifferent, though he mynde to do no maner of iniurie for all that he receyued giftes and rewardes: Yet bicauſe it is a great coniecture, &amp; an euyl ſuſpection of vnryghtuouſneſſe, bicauſe it maketh the ſentence to be ſuſpecte: therefore he wylleth Iudges for nothinge to take any maner of rewardes: he declareth to them, that the receyuynge of gyftes is counted in the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them whiche are curſed by the mouth of the Lorde. He decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth furthermore, that the heade
<pb facs="tcp:1773:26"/>rulers of commune wealthes, are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to prouid for Iudges ſuch ſufficiient &amp; honeſt lyuynge: that they ſhoulde not neede to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maner of rewardes and giftes that they maye be able to fynde them ſelues and theirs therwyth honeſtly: ſyth that they do beſtow their tyme in the commune af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and buſines, ſith that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not both labour for their owne familie and ſerue the communes alſo, in the office wherunto they be called. Thys leſſon howe well many Iudges and other perſons whiche are ſette to be indifferent betwene man and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do obſerue and keepe (I can accuſe no man) but the tedious and long ſuetes of the poore, the ſhort and quicke diſpatch of the riche, maketh men to ſuſpecte that all thynge is not accordingly as it ought for to be.
<pb facs="tcp:1773:27"/>It hath bene often tymes ſene &amp; perceyued, that the ſentence of the poore mannes cauſe hath ben determined before it hathe bene hearde what the poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might ſay and lay for him ſelfe. I would wiſhe and deſire that all Iudges ſhoulde gyue theyr ſeruauntes great charge that thei do receiue no maner of gyftes or rewardes and that they their ſelfe ſhoulde gyue to them ſuche wages, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhoulde not neede to take anie thinge of any man. For all that whiche is gyuen to them: is to ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyne fauoure and friendſhyp in theyr cauſes: to be good vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to remembre them to theyr mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be at leaſure, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſueters are gone, when the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte maye boldly ſpeake, then to ſpeake a good worde for them: to healpe to diſpatche the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which
<pb facs="tcp:1773:27"/>all together ſmelleth not of the beſt. But ſome Iudges and other officers hauing great and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent liuinges by their offices, haue ben ſclaundered (I feare me of the truth) that theyr ſeruauntes and officers vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue had none other wages of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their ſeruice, then ſuch vauntages and gaynes as they myghte gette in theyr ſeruice, of them whiche are ſueters, ſkant hauynge of theyr maiſters a good liuerie once in a yere.

If al this
<pb facs="tcp:1773:28"/>be true (as I doubte me it is to true) what doth then folowe, but that he whiche myght beſte giue, ſhoulde ſpeede beſt, Lorde money being the chiefe iudge in his cauſe whether it be ryght or wronge. I haue hearde alſo of manie men whiche haue wroughte, yea and boughte them ſelues into greate mennes ſeruice: neither for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, nor for the deſire to do them anie honeſte ſeruice, nor yet that they myght thereby be either the more godly or iuſt: but that they myght beare the greater ſwynge bicauſe they belonge to great me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the countrey where they doe dwell, that they might beare and make ſuche a bragge in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis, that no man ſhoulde once route agaynſt them or ſay blacke to theyr eye what ſo euer extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they do.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifuly to you. The ſence &amp; mynde of the Prophete is: that all men which do feare God, and do walke thorowe a pure &amp; a perfecte fayth in his preceptes, ſhal come to eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal bliſſe and lyfe euerlaſtyng, for to ſuche men the price of oure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and of the forgyuenes of our ſinne is layed vp of God in our Lorde Ieſu Chriſt.

               <p>The Prophete ſayeth that the
